# hello-world
 Hey there!
 
 JadeRichardson here, I'm a third year computer science undergrad at California State University San Marcos.
 I'm proficient C++, MIPS assembly, and I know how to code a little in Javascript, Clojure, Java. (and HTML and CSS if you consider those programming languages!)
 I also totally dig rock climbing and passionate people. AND LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH! HUZZAH!
